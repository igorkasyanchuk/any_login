gemspec

# Declare any dependencies that are still in development here instead of in
# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.

# For development
# group :development do
#   gem 'devise'
#   gem "jquery-rails"
#   gem "quiet_assets"
#   gem "pry"
# end

# To run tests
group :development, :test do
  gem "capybara"
  gem 'selenium-webdriver'
  gem "sqlite3"
  gem "webrick"
  gem "devise"
  gem "authlogic"
  gem "clearance"
  gem 'sprockets-rails', :require => 'sprockets/railtie'
  gem "sorcery"

  gem 'json'

  gem "pry"
  gem "pry-rails"
  gem "pry-byebug"
end
